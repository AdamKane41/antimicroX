## Description

antimicroX is a graphical program used to map keyboard keys and mouse controls
to a gamepad. This program is useful for playing PC games using a gamepad that
do not have any form of built-in gamepad support. However, you can use this 
program to control any desktop application with a gamepad; on Linux, this
means that your system has to be running an X environment in order to run
this program.

This program is currently supported under various Linux
distributions, Windows (Vista and later), and FreeBSD. However functionality of application
has been tested only on Linux (Arch Linux and Ubuntu). More systems will be tested in the future.

Informations about all developers from AntiMicro team and main creator (Ryochan7) are included in 
application. Their **old versions** are here:

## Build Dependencies

This program is written in C++ using the [Qt](https://www.qt.io/)
framework. A C++ compiler and a proper C++ build environment will need to be
installed on your system prior to building this program. Under Debian and
Debian-based distributions like Ubuntu, the
easiest way to get a base build environment set up is to install the
meta-package **build-essential**. The following packages are required to be
installed on your system in order to build this program:

* g++
* cmake
* extra-cmake-modules
* qttools5-dev and qttools5-dev-tools (qt5-tools on distros based on Arch Linux) (Qt5 support)
* libsdl2-dev (sdl2 on distros based on Arch Linux) (SDL2)
* libxi-dev (libxi on distros based on Arch Linux) (Optional. Needed to compile with X11 and uinput support)
* libxtst-dev (libxtst on distros based on Arch Linux) (Optional. Needed to compile with XTest support)
* libx11-dev (libx11 on distros based on Arch Linux) (Needed to compile with Qt5 support)
* itstool (extracts messages from XML files and outputs PO template files, then merges translations from MO files to create translated XML files)
* gettext
* libqt5x11extras5-dev

### Building Under Linux

In order to build this program, open a terminal and cd into the antimicroX
directory. Enter the following commands in order to build the program:

    cd antimicroX
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    sudo make install
    
or

```
cd antimicrox
cmake --build build
cmake --install build
```


If you're an Arch Linux or Arch Linux based distribution user:

```
git clone https://github.com/archlinux-lucjan/archlinux-packages.git
cd antimicrox-git
makepkg -sric
```

or

```
trizen -S antimicrox-git
```

from [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/antimicrox-git/)

### Building with Flatpak

#### Additional Dependencies

* flatpak 
* flatpak-builder


#### Compilation & Installation

This tutorial is about installing antimicroX with flatpak locally. As first you need a com.github.juliagoda.antimicroX.json file, that is placed in main folder. You can for example copy and paste content to local file. Link to raw content of json file is [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juliagoda/antimicroX/master/com.github.juliagoda.antimicroX.json).


1. Download and install Flatpak repo:

`flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo`

2. Add a runtime with Qt and all KDE Frameworks 5

`flatpak install flathub org.kde.Platform//5.11 org.kde.Sdk//5.11`

3. Create new directories for building and creating repo

```
mkdir build-dir
mkdir repo
```

4. Build antimicroX

`flatpak-builder build-dir com.github.juliagoda.antimicroX.json`

5. Test the build of application

`flatpak-builder --run build-dir com.github.juliagoda.antimicroX.json antimicroX`

6. Create repository for application

`flatpak-builder --repo=repo --force-clean build-dir com.github.juliagoda.antimicroX.json`

7. Add the repository to flatpak locally

`flatpak --user remote-add --no-gpg-verify antimicroX repo`

8. Install application

`flatpak --user install antimicroX com.github.juliagoda.antimicroX`


#### Run antimicroX

If you have installed antimicroX locally with success, you can run application:

`flatpak run com.github.juliagoda.antimicroX`



#### Updating

To update all your installed applications and runtimes to the latest version, execute:

`flatpak update`


#### Uninstall antimicroX

1. Delete a remote repository

`flatpak --user remote-delete antimicroX`

2. Delete application

`flatpak uninstall com.github.juliagoda.antimicroX`

<br/>

## Testing Under Linux

If you are having problems with antimicroX detecting a controller or
detecting all axes and buttons, you should test the controller outside of
antimicroX to check if the problem is with antimicroX or not. The two endorsed
programs for testing gamepads outside of antimicroX are **sdl-jstest**
(**sdl2-jstest**) and **evtest**. SDL2 utilizes evdev on Linux so performing
testing with older programs that use joydev won't be as helpful since some
devices behave a bit differently between the two systems. Another method also exist, 
which can be found [here](https://github.com/juliagoda/SDL_JoystickButtonNames).

<br/>

## Support

In order to obtain support, you can post an issue [here](https://github.com/juliagoda/antimicroX/issues) .

<br/>

## Bugs

Application's bugs will be fixed. There are created tests for detecting bugs. Of course, I'm open to proposals or questions from users. 

<br/>

## Shoutout

A big, original inspiration for this program was the program QJoyPad.
